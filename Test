🔸 Q1: Early Challenges in the New Model

> “One of the early challenges we faced was adapting to a more collaborative way of working — especially with Customer Advocacy and UX teams.

As developers, we were used to jumping straight into delivery. But with the new model, we had to really understand user journeys and feedback before building anything. That was a big mindset shift.

Initially, it was tough to connect to that process. But once we ran journey mapping sessions and user persona bootcamps, the team started to see the value.

It helped us build more purpose-driven solutions and made a real difference in how we approach problems today.”

🔸 Q2: Tools & Processes That Improved Developer Experience

> “Improving delivery speed and developer experience has been a big focus for us.

GitHub Copilot has been a great addition — it speeds up code writing, removes boilerplate, and keeps us in flow.

We also adopted LaunchDarkly for feature flagging. It lets us roll out features gradually, run A/B tests, and turn things off instantly if needed — without redeploying. That’s been huge for safer releases.

And we’re exploring Playwright for end-to-end testing. It helps us catch issues early and improve quality before code even hits production.

Altogether, these tools have helped us move faster, with more confidence and less risk.”
